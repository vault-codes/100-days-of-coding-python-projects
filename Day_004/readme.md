📜 The Challenge
Yesterday, fate was sealed by a branching path (Treasure Island). Today, fate is sealed by a random number. This project is the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, built to solidify two crucial pillars of programming: Randomisation and Lists.

This challenge moved me beyond simple user input to integrating the unpredictable nature of the machine itself. The computer doesn't choose; it relies on a hidden mechanism to seal the outcome.

🗝️ Core Python Concepts Demonstrated
This game masters the skills necessary for dynamic, unpredictable program behavior:

Randomisation: Utilizing the built-in Python random module to generate the computer's choice, making the game truly competitive.

Python Lists: Storing the possible moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors) in a list to manage choices efficiently.

Indexing: Using random numbers to precisely select elements from the list.

Nested Control Flow: Combining the random choice with the user's choice to determine the final winner, loser, or draw.

⚔️ How to Face the Machine
To challenge the computer's logic, you'll need only your terminal.
