🔒 Day 5: The Cipher Key — Easy Password Generator
By: Vault Codes
📜 The Challenge
Security relies on complexity, but complexity doesn't have to rely on guesswork. This project is a foundational utility: an Easy Password Generator.

Built upon the skills of Lists, Randomization, and Loops, this code takes simple elements (letters, symbols, and numbers) and combines them into an unpredictable sequence. It’s the first step in mastering data protection—turning predictable input into unbreakable output.

🗝️ Core Python Concepts Demonstrated
This project successfully integrates the primary concepts of the week:

Python Loops (for loops): Used to iterate and build the password structure, ensuring the exact required number of characters are included.

Lists and Indexing: Managing pools of possible characters (letters, numbers, symbols) and selecting them efficiently using list indexing.

Randomisation (random.choice & random.shuffle): Utilizing Python's random module to select characters and, crucially, to randomize the final order of the password elements, boosting security.
